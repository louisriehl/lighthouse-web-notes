# Breakout Session Mon Sept 24

## Things to remember
* Don't code along, it's more important to follow what is being said and take notes
 * Focus on the approach more than anything!

## Terminal
* Be comfortable with changing directories, moving around, etc.

## Problem Solving Approach

In this example, attempting to solve Adding Numbers exercise. Note: **You can open a whole folder in Sublime to easily hop through its contents, very useful for navigating complex files.**

* To start solving our issue, consider making a markdown ReadMe file stating goals and approaches
 * In larger projects, this can help us keep track of what we need to get done.
* Consider documentation to understand how to solve issues if you don't know how
* Other way to turn string into numbers: parseInt(number, base) (eg 10). Number is better if expecting non-integer numbers

* VI editor (entered by entering commit mode without -m)
 * VI has a command mode and editing mode. Command mode shows blank line.
 * Hitting I leads to insert mode, exited with escape
 * When entering the commit message, first line is title, says change, and rest is explanation
 * :wq, :q, or :q! to write quit, quit or quit without saving this mode

* On push and commits...
 * Only one -u push is needed: it establishes which branch we're talking to, it can then be followed by "push" only
